    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><u>Last Updated: 2020/07/08</u></p>
    <p>
      VoteByMail.io is a platform provided by Civex Incorporated (“Civex,” “we,” or “us”) that allows civic groups to help voters to register to vote by mail through landing pages they create. This Privacy Policy refers to these civic groups as “Organizers.” This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you visit VoteByMail.io (the “Site”), including if you register to vote, how we use the information we collect, how we disclose the information we collect, and your rights.
      We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Site to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
